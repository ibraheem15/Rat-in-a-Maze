# Rat in a Maze
Rat in a Maze is a popular Data Structure Assignment given to many students to practice their algorithms. I have implemented this game using Stacks and Linked List. 

Futhermore, I also have implemented Maps from STL in this program to implement the functionality of visited function that where the rat has visited in the maze.

It also includes file handling to tell the program where the hurdes are, where to locate the hurdles, and what size should the array(maze) would be. This all would be taken from the External text file.
